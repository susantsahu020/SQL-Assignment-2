Title: Counting Organizations

This application will read the mailbox data (mbox.txt) and count the number of email messages per organization (i.e. domain name of the email address) using a database with the following schema to maintain the counts.

CREATE TABLE Counts (org TEXT, count INTEGER)

When you have run the program on mbox.txt upload the resulting database file above for grading.

If you run the program multiple times in testing or with different files, make sure to empty out the data before each run.

The data file for this application is mbox.txt
